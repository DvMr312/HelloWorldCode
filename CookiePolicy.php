    <h5><strong>Cookie Policy</strong></h5>
    <p>Our privacy policy explains our principles regarding the collection, processing and storage of your information. 
       In particular, this policy explains how we, our partners and users of our services deploy cookies, as well as the options you have to control them.<br></p>
       
    <p>What are cookies?<br>
    Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, which are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded into a browser. 
    They are widely used to "remember" you and your preferences, either for a single visit (using a "session cookie") or for repeated visits (using a "persistent cookie"). 
    They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as enabling users to register and stay logged in. 
    Cookies may be set by the site you are visiting (called "first-party cookies") or by third parties, such as those serving content or providing advertising or analytics services on the website ("third-party cookies").
    Websites and HTML e-mails may also contain other tracking technologies such as "web beacons" or "pixels". 
    These are generally small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for purposes similar to those of cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, 
    although they are not stored on your computer in the same way. Therefore, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.</p>

    <p>How we use cookies<br>
    We use cookies for one reason only. They are required to access the HelloWorldCode forum. These cookies are used when you register. We collect your name, first name, nickname and password, which we do not share with anyone.<br></p>

    <p>Where we place cookies<br>
    We place cookies in our secure database and will not share them with anyone.</p>
